Resized or cropped images should be added in this directory after you run the demo.php :\r\n\r\n- 3105589762_crop.jpg\r\n- 3105589762_keepratio_by_h.jpg\r\n- 3105589762_keepratio_by_w.jpg\r\n- butterfly_crop.jpg\r\n- butterfly_h150_keepratio_by_h.jpg\r\n- butterfly_w600_keepratio_by_w.jpg\r\n \r\n",
